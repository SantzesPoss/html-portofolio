                <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Thanasis</strong>, and I am a <strong>former Naval Officer eager to embark on a new career</strong> filled with exciting challenges.</p><br>
                <p>I was born and raised in <strong>Athens, Greece</strong>, where I developed a passion for music and gymnastics. During my teenage years, I played water polo, and my love for swimming continued during my time at the Naval Academy. There, I was a proud member of the swimming team, competing in tournaments and specializing in the 100m butterfly.</p><br>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. <strong>Here, you'll discover my educational background, professional experiences, technical skills, and personal projects</strong>. I look forward to connecting and exploring potential collaborations.</p><br>

                <p>My journey began with a strong academic foundation, <strong>achieving a <u>92.5%</u> pass rate in the Panhellenic exams in 2007</strong>, which <strong>granted me access to all Greek universities</strong>. I chose to pursue my <strong> studies at the Naval Academy</strong>, seeking the discipline necessary to fulfill many of my ambitions. <strong>I graduated as an ensign in 2011</strong>.</p><br>
                <p>Following my <strong>bachelor's degree</strong>, which I completed in four years (within the five-year deadline), <strong>I served as a naval officer in the Hellenic Navy for over 15 years with <u>a prestigious ten-year period in submarine service</u></strong>, taking on numerous positions of responsibility that demonstrated my reliability in serious roles. My roles included <strong>executive officer</strong> on a gunboat, <strong>operations manager, weapons stewardship manager</strong> and <strong>navigation officer</strong>.</p><br>
